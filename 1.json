{"name": "Front Yard",
 "description": "You are facing a massive green house with a long stone walkway that leads to concrete steps. Small lanterns on each side of the walkway create an eerie glow, and are your only source of light. Long vines encase the house, hanging down to conceal most of the porch. The steps lead to a heavy wooden door that sits back in the shadows of the archway. Head north to enter the house.",
